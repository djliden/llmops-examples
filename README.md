# llmops-examples

This repository contains example code and notebooks related to mlflow, llmops, and related techniques and technologies.

## Example Notebooks

* [Comparing LLMs with MLFlow](mlflow-compare-llms.ipynb) - This notebook demonstrates how to use MLFlow to compare different text generation models from Hugging Face and compare different generation configurations for those models.

* [Comparing OpenAI Models to Open-Source Transformers Models with MLFlow](compare-openai-transformers.ipynb) - This notebook shows how to compare outputs from open-source LLMs to outputs from hosted proprietary models using MLFlow.

* [Evaluating RAG quality with MLFlow](eval-retrieval-mlflow.ipynb) - This notebook demonstrates how to use MLFlow to evaluate the quality of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

* [Loading Spark dataframes and Delta tables as Hugging Face datasets](huggingface-from-spark.ipynb) - This notebook demonstrates how to create Hugging Face datasets from Spark dataframes and Delta tables.

* [Inference Parameters with MLFlow](mlflow-inference-params.ipynb) - This notebook showcases how to use MLFlow to manage and track inference parameters for machine learning models.

* [MLFlow Prompt Engineering UI Example Notebook](mlflow-prompt-eng-ui.ipynb) - This notebook provides an example of how to use the MLflow Prompt Engineering UI to compare model outputs across different prompts, templates, and models.
